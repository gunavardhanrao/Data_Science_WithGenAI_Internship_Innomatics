📚 Data Science with Gen AI Internship Repository
🚀 Overview
This repository documents the projects, code, and resources developed during the Data Science with Generative AI Internship program at Innomatics Research Labs, Hyderabad.

The internship focuses on bridging the gap between traditional data science methodologies and the cutting-edge applications of Generative AI (Gen AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This portfolio demonstrates practical skills in data manipulation, machine learning pipeline development, prompt engineering, and the deployment of AI-powered solutions.

📂 Internship Project Portfolio
Here are the main projects completed during the internship, showcasing hands-on experience:

1. 🤖 RAG System for Document Q&A
Description: Developed a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable accurate question-answering over custom documents.

Technologies Used: LangChain, Hugging Face Embeddings, ChromaDB/Pinecone (Vector Store), LLM (e.g., Llama 2 or GPT-3.5).

Deliverable: A system capable of generating context-aware answers that cite their source documents, minimizing LLM hallucination.

2. 📝 LLM Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis
Description: Fine-tuned a smaller open-source LLM on a domain-specific dataset (e.g., customer reviews) to improve its performance on sentiment classification tasks compared to zero-shot prompting.

Technologies Used: PyTorch/TensorFlow, Hugging Face transformers library, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques like LoRA.

Deliverable: A custom, resource-efficient LLM specialized for high-accuracy sentiment detection.

3. 📉 Classical ML Pipeline (Classification/Regression)
Description: Implemented an end-to-end machine learning project (e.g., House Price Prediction or Customer Churn Prediction), focusing on robust EDA, feature engineering, and model deployment.

Technologies Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Model Persistence (pickle), Streamlit (for UI).

Deliverable: A production-ready ML model and a simple web application for predictions.
